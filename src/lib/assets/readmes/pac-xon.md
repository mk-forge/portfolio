2. Double-click the JAR file or run:
```bash
java -jar pac-xon-1.0.0.jar
```

### Option 2: Build from source

## Known issue

### Orange ghost respawn

In the original PAC-XON game, the orange ghost respawns after being eaten. In this implementation, the orange ghost does not respawn. This is a deliberate design decision due to a technical limitation where the orange ghost would sometimes respawn in a position where it couldn't move properly.

If you want to restore the original behavior, modify `applyBallEffect()` in `Map.java` by removing the condition `if (i != 0)` that skips the orange ghost during respawn.
